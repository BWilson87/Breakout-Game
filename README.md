# Breakout Game

**Breakout Game** is a simple Java implementation of the classic arcade game. It demonstrates my understanding of object-oriented programming, basic game loops, collision detection, and user input handling in Java.

- Object-oriented design (`Ball`, `Paddle`, `Brick`, `BreakoutPanel`, `Sprite`, `Settings`)
- Basic collision detection and bounce physics
- Keyboard input for paddle movement
- Simple game loop for smooth gameplay
- Modular and readable code structure

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How to Compile and Run**

1. **Make sure you have Java installed** (Java 8 or higher recommended).

2. **Clone or download this repository**, then open a terminal and navigate to the `src` folder:

   ```
   cd src
   ```
   
3.  Compile all Java files in the breakout package:
    ```
    javac breakout/*.java
    ```
4.  Run the game:
   ``` 
   java breakout.Breakout
   ```

  
   
## Future Improvements
